Hi!
The only thing that you need to do to run my files is to press the run python file icon
for the main.py file. The files for amazon_questions.py and the csv files should be on your
computer, and I should have sent them all in the folder that I submitted on gradescope.

Another thing, the code may not do anything at first, but that is because all of the images
will open up either in your browser or in the python app?? (visualizer?). The ML model
visualizer will come up as an image on the python app and it should just pop up on your screen,
as well as the four pie charts. Everything else is coded in plotly and should open up on your
browser. Note that the code will only progress once you CLOSE OUT of the window with the
seaborn/mathplotlib visualization (you don't need to close out the plotly tabs).
